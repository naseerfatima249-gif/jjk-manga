            <h2>Welcome to the World of Curses and Sorcerers</h2>
            <p>If you're new to Jujutsu Kaisen, you're about to embark on one of the most thrilling manga experiences of recent years. Created by Gege Akutami, this supernatural action series has captured the hearts of millions worldwide with its compelling characters, intricate power system, and emotionally charged storytelling. This beginner's guide will prepare you for everything you need to know before diving into this cursed world.</p>
            
            <p>The series presents a dark fantasy setting where invisible creatures called curses—born from the negative emotions of humanity—threaten the world. A secret society of jujutsu sorcerers works to protect ordinary people from these malevolent entities. The story begins when an ordinary high school student named Yuji Itadori becomes entangled in this hidden war, forever changing his fate and the world around him.</p>
            
            <h2>Understanding the Basic Premise</h2>
            <p>Before you start reading, it helps to understand the foundational concepts that drive the narrative. In this world, cursed energy flows from negative human emotions like fear, hatred, and sadness. This energy accumulates and eventually manifests as curses—supernatural beings that range from mindless monsters to highly intelligent entities with complex personalities and motivations.</p>
            
            <p>Jujutsu sorcerers are individuals who can perceive and manipulate cursed energy, using it to fight against curses and protect humanity. Each sorcerer possesses unique abilities called cursed techniques, which are often inherited through bloodlines or developed through training. The variety of these techniques creates exciting and unpredictable battles throughout the series.</p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>Pro Tip for New Readers</h4>
                <p>Don't worry if you don't understand every concept immediately. The manga introduces its power system gradually, and many readers find that their understanding deepens through rereading key chapters. Focus on enjoying the story and characters first.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Meet the Main Characters</h2>
            <p>One of the manga's greatest strengths is its memorable cast. Here are the core characters you'll meet early in your reading journey:</p>
            
            <div class="character-cards">
                <div class="character-card">
                    <h4>Yuji Itadori</h4>
                    <p>The protagonist—an athletic and kind-hearted high school student whose life changes dramatically when he swallows a cursed object containing the legendary curse Ryomen Sukuna. His physical prowess and determination make him a formidable sorcerer in training.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="character-card">
                    <h4>Megumi Fushiguro</h4>
                    <p>A first-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High who comes from a prestigious sorcerer family. His stoic demeanor hides a complex past and strong sense of justice. His shadow-based cursed technique allows him to summon powerful shikigami.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="character-card">
                    <h4>Nobara Kugisaki</h4>
                    <p>A confident and fierce first-year student from the countryside. Her straw doll technique and unwavering spirit make her a vital member of the team. She provides both comic relief and emotional depth to the group dynamic.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="character-card">
                    <h4>Satoru Gojo</h4>
                    <p>The strongest jujutsu sorcerer alive and teacher to the first-year students. His overwhelming power, playful personality, and mysterious eyes hidden behind a blindfold make him an instantly iconic character in the manga world.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h2>What Makes This Series Special</h2>
            <p>Several elements combine to make Jujutsu Kaisen stand out in the crowded manga landscape. The series masterfully balances dark themes with moments of humor and heart, creating an emotional rollercoaster that keeps readers deeply invested. Unlike some shonen series that protect their main cast, this manga isn't afraid to put its beloved characters through genuine danger and loss.</p>
            
            <h3>The Power System</h3>
            <p>The cursed energy system provides a flexible yet logical framework for battles. Domain Expansions—guaranteed-hit attacks that create a pocket dimension—serve as ultimate techniques that provide some of the series' most visually stunning moments. Binding vows add strategic depth by allowing characters to trade restrictions for power increases.</p>
            
            <h3>Thematic Depth</h3>
            <p>Beyond the action, the manga explores meaningful themes about the nature of humanity, the weight of responsibility, and what it means to live a fulfilling life. Characters grapple with questions of mortality, justice, and the consequences of their choices in ways that resonate with readers long after they finish reading.</p>
            
            <h2>Reading Order and Recommendations</h2>
            <p>For the optimal reading experience, start with Chapter 1 of the main series and read sequentially. The story is designed to introduce concepts and characters gradually, building complexity as you progress. Avoid the temptation to skip ahead, as seemingly minor details often become significant later.</p>
            
            <h3>About the Prequel</h3>
            <p>Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is a four-chapter prequel that follows a different protagonist, Yuta Okkotsu, before the events of the main series. You can read it before starting the main manga or after completing the first major arc (around chapter 64). Both approaches work well—reading it first provides additional context, while reading it later allows certain reveals to have more impact.</p>

                <h4>Recommended Reading Pace</h4>
                <p>While it's tempting to binge-read the entire series, consider pacing yourself through major arcs. Taking breaks between arcs allows you to process events, discuss with the community, and appreciate the story's structure. The series rewards attentive reading, so don't rush through climactic moments.</p>

            <h2>What to Expect: Content Warnings</h2>
            <p>Jujutsu Kaisen contains mature content that may not be suitable for all readers. The series features graphic violence, body horror, death of named characters, and psychological themes. While these elements serve the story's dark fantasy setting, readers sensitive to such content should be prepared.</p>
            
            <p>That said, the series balances its darker moments with genuine warmth, humor, and hope. The bonds between characters and their determination to protect what they love provide emotional anchors throughout even the most intense arcs.</p>
            
            <h2>Tips for First-Time Readers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pay attention to dialogue:</strong> Akutami plants significant foreshadowing and character development in conversations that might seem casual on first read.</li>
                <li><strong>Appreciate the artwork:</strong> Take time to examine fight sequences panel by panel. The visual storytelling conveys information and emotion that enhances the narrative.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't spoil yourself:</strong> Major plot twists hit harder when experienced organically. Avoid wiki pages and social media discussions until you're caught up.</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace confusion:</strong> Some concepts become clearer with context from later chapters. If something doesn't make sense immediately, keep reading.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider rereading:</strong> Many fans report that the series improves on rereading as they catch details and foreshadowing they missed initially.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Joining the Community</h2>
